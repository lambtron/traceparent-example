# Distributd tracing example

This monorepo demonstrates simple distributed tracing. Gateway (service A) sends
a fetch request to Processor (service B).

You can get immediate logs, traces, and metrics in
[OTel](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/open_telemetry/) in any Node
or Deno program by running it in [Deno](https://deno.com).
